Forms are used in webpages for the user to enter their required details that further send it to the server for processing. The data entered into a form needs to be in the right format and certain fields need to be filled in order to effectively use the submitted form. So that's become we need form validation.

In this project, I used **HTML** to make a basic structure of the form. I have used **CSS** to style web form. **JavaScript** was used to validate data that is input by the user.<br>

The user should have to fill all fields. In the Quantity section, the user should fill numbers between 0 to 13. (That means 1 to 12 only.) Also, two of the password fields should be matched together. Otherwise, the user can't submit the form.
